    "summary": "The Erebus Protocol dashboard page acts as an initial gateway, prominently featuring a 'Connect Wallet' prompt. It emphasizes the core value proposition of 'complete privacy' and access to a 'Zero Knowledge protocol on Solana Devnet'. The page guides users to connect Solana-compatible wallets such as Phantom or Solflare to proceed. Crucially, no actual dashboard content, trading interfaces, specific privacy controls or level selectors, or any preview of functionalities are visible before a wallet is successfully connected.",
